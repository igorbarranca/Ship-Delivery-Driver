# Ship Delivery Driver
Very small Unity Project inspired by the first task of the "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D Online Course - 2021" from GameDev.tv". 

This is an academic project born for starting to increase my programming and UnityEngine skills.

I dealt with: - new Unity Input System
              - 2D level creation with Tile Palette
              - Basic object pooling deactivating one object and re-setting his position instead of Instantiate it again
              - Basic rules of Trigger and Collisions
              - Basic score system
              - and more...
            
The game is uplodaded on Itch.io

Thanks for the time you have dedicated to this. Have a nice day.
